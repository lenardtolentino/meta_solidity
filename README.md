This Solidity code defines a basic ERC-20 compatible token contract named `My_Token`. Let's break down its functionality:

1. **SPDX-License-Identifier**: This is a comment specifying the license under which the contract code is released. In this case, it's GPL-3.0.

2. **Pragma Directive**: This specifies the version of the Solidity compiler to be used. `pragma solidity 0.8.18;` indicates that the code is written to be compatible with version 0.8.18 of Solidity or higher.

3. **Contract Declaration**: 
   ```solidity
   contract My_Token {
       // Contract code goes here
   }
   ```
   This declares a Solidity contract named `My_Token`.

4. **State Variables**:
   - `tokenName`: A string variable representing the name of the token (e.g., "META").
   - `tokenAbbrv`: A string variable representing the abbreviated name of the token (e.g., "MTA").
   - `totalSupply`: An unsigned integer variable representing the total supply of the token. Initialized to 0 and will increase when tokens are minted and decrease when tokens are burned.
   - `balances`: A mapping from addresses to unsigned integers representing the token balances of each address.

5. **Mint Function**:
   ```solidity
   function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
       totalsupply += _value;
       balances[_address] += _value;
   }
   ```
   This function allows the contract owner to mint new tokens and assign them to a specific address (`_address`). It increases the total supply (`totalsupply`) by the specified amount (`_value`) and adds that amount to the balance of the specified address.

6. **Burn Function**:
   ```solidity
   function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
       if (balances[_address] >= _value) {
           totalsupply -= _value;
           balances[_address] -= _value;
       }
   }
   ```
   This function allows token holders to burn (destroy) their tokens. It checks if the balance of the specified address is greater than or equal to the amount to be burned (`_value`). If it is, it decreases the total supply and the balance of the specified address by the specified amount.

This contract provides basic functionalities for creating, minting, and burning ERC-20 tokens. However, it lacks other features such as transfer functions and event logging, which are essential for a fully functional ERC-20 token.
